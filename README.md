# Liberá The Wiki

Liberá the Wiki is a userscript which redirects wikis from Fandom (which is a closed source platform), to MediaWiki alternatives (which is part of the Wikipedia foundation, therefore it's open source).

Currently the userscript redirects the following wikis:

* Banjo Kazooie
* Half-Life
